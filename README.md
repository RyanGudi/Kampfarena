Design Pattern

Factory Design Pattern - Creates different types of Code-a-mons based on a string input
-Trainer can acquire more code-a-mons (max of 6)
-Code-a-mons should be of different types and gain advantages/disadvantages
-Code-a-mons set stats requirements

Decorator Design Pattern - Dynamically attaches an existing Code-a-mon with a new Attack
-Code-a-mon set attack stats requirements
-Code-a-mons learn new moves at specific levels
-Attacks deal more damage depending on opponent type

Singleton Design Pattern - Global instance of Day/Night/Weather cycles
-Day/Night cycles
-Each cycle should have its own weather event
-Weather events boosts the corresponding code-a-mon's attack power
